<h1>TIC-TAC-TOE</h1>
<p>I built this game as my 3rd milestoneproject, learning Python.<br> 
The game is supposed to be an easy but fun game, the classic tic-tac-toe.</p>
<p>Primary goal of the game:<br> 
<ul>
<li>Get three in row to win</li>
<li>Horizontal, vertical or diagonal will work</li>
<li>Player 1 (human) and player 2 (computer) takes turns to place their marker on the board</li>
<li>Players will be represented by X and O on the board</li>
<li>When the board is full and there is no winner, itÂ´s a tie</li>
</ul>
